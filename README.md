# nanowire-resonances
Use Mie theory to calculate the absorption and scattering of nanowires.
Please run the demo notebook to get a quick view of what the code can calculate.
The notebook is available as both jupyter notebook and as a python percentage script.

This package comes with a small database of refractive indices for different semiconductors. 
Please use them at your discretion, but check carefully before using the results for something serious.
